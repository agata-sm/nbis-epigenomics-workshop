Please read carefully and follow the instructions so we can have a good start to the course. Contact us in case anything in unclear. Computational Resources During the course we will be using Uppsala University\u2019s high performance computer cluster (Uppmax) as well as run scripts locally on laptops using R and RStudio. To be able to follow exercises we ask you to configure access to Uppmax ; install R and RStudio on your laptop; install Integrative Genomics Viewer on your laptop. Uppmax Computational resources are provided by SNIC / Uppmax . To be able to use them create a user account (only if you do not already have one); associate your user account with the course project. Create user account & request membership in the course project (for those new to Uppmax) This involves few steps. Briefly, registering at SUPR ; accepting the User Agreement; becoming a member in the project ( XXXX ); applying for an account at Uppmax. To go through the steps follow the instructions on Uppmax website. While at this keep this information handy: Cluster name: rackham Project ID: XXXX Request membership in the course project (for those already having Uppmax account) log in to SUPR; under Projects: Requesting Membership in Projects, request membership in XXXX Check configuration (everyone) After you complete setting-up login to rackham.uppmax.uu.se type id in the command line copy the output of the command and email back (to the course organisers at edu.epigenomics@nbis.se) [A guide on how to log-in for the first time]((http://www.uppmax.uu.se/support/user-guides/guide\u2013first-login-to-uppmax/) R and RStudio We will also be using the latest version of R and RStudio locally. Both of these work on computers running Linux, Windows and Macintosh operating systems. RStudio is a set of tools as well as an editor that facilitates the use of R (R ICE). Over the last years it has become a very popular tool and in many ways become a de-facto standard for working with R. Note that on same operative systems it will be easier to install and run R and RStudio if you are administrator of your own computer and hence are allowed to install software on your machine. If you do not have these privileges please ask your system administrator to install the latest version of R and RStudio . IGV To install, follow the instructions on the IGV website .
